About the project :- This is a course project given by my institute (IIIT-G) on DBMS. We were required to create a database for properties and maintain records of 
1. details of properrty
2. details of agent assigned to properties
3. which agent sold or rented which propperty
We needed to code a GUI that lets 
1. Customer search properties using filters like maximum price, minimum price, locality, type of propeperty etc
2. Provide each agent a account that shows for each agent his profile, properties assigned to him, option to sell or rent more properties etc
3. Database Administrator add new properties,agents,owners. See Sales report of each agent etc
